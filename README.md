## Finding the right company
### The breakout list
https://breakoutlist.com/
https://breakoutlist.com/advice/

The breakout list is a website which creates data and advice from angels, VCs, late stage investors, and CEOs. 
This is a great resource for advice at all stages, and has has a list of companies which they recommend looking at. 
These companies are curated based on the idea that a person joining a startup should join one that is on a *breakthrough* trajectory - becasue being on a winning team is 
important in establishing a career.

Breakout comapnies are generally post-series B, which (typically) indicates that they have established PMF and are in a growth stage.

The advice from Breakoutlist is curated posts from many influential people in the startup / entrepreneurial scene. 
This advice is generally great and can lead to many rabbit holes of thoughts.
